## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://deviniter.vercel.app/) -->

Many members of Gen Z struggle with managing their finances and planning for the future. <strong>Clario</strong> is designed to provide greater <strong>clarity</strong> around spending habits and financial decisions.

In its initial release, <strong>Clario</strong> offers a simple platform where users can easily track their expenses, make notes about their spending, and visualize their income and expenses through intuitive charts.

In future updates, we plan to introduce additional features such as group expense sharing for outings, the ability to organize savings into multiple categories (e.g., tuition fees, family savings), and a dedicated application for <strong>Clario's users</strong>.
